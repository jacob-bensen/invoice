## INCOME-CRITICAL

### 1. [DONE 2026-04-23] [GROWTH] Upgrade Modal at Free-Plan Invoice Limit [S]

**App:** QuickInvoice (Node.js)
**Impact:** HIGH — highest-intent conversion moment in the funnel
**Effort:** Low
**Prerequisites:** None

Replace the dead-end at the 3-invoice limit with a full-screen Alpine.js modal in `views/dashboard.ejs` and `views/invoice-form.ejs`.

**Sub-tasks:**
1. In `routes/invoices.js`, locate where the server-side invoice limit is enforced; confirm it returns a detectable signal (redirect with query flag or JSON error).
2. Add an Alpine.js `x-data` component to `views/dashboard.ejs` and `views/invoice-form.ejs` that opens the modal when the limit signal is detected.
3. Build modal body: list Pro unlocks (unlimited invoices, email sending, payment links); single CTA button to the existing Stripe Checkout route; social-proof line ("Join X freelancers on Pro").
4. Test on a free account that has hit 3 invoices — modal must appear before any server error page.

### 2. [DONE 2026-04-23] [GROWTH] Stripe Payment Links on Invoices (Pro Feature) [M]

**App:** QuickInvoice (Node.js)
**Impact:** HIGH — turns product into a payment collection tool; dramatically raises switching cost
**Effort:** Medium
**Prerequisites:** Stripe account (already required)

**Sub-tasks:**
1. Apply migration: `ALTER TABLE invoices ADD COLUMN payment_link_url TEXT;` (update `db/schema.sql`).
2. In `routes/invoices.js`, when invoice status changes to `'sent'` and `user.is_pro`, call the Stripe API to create a Payment Link for the invoice total; store the returned URL in `payment_link_url`.
3. In `views/invoice-view.ejs`, render a **"Pay Now"** button linking to `payment_link_url` (visible only when the link exists and user is Pro).
4. In `views/invoice-print.ejs`, render the payment link as a URL and optionally an inline SVG QR code (no server dependency).
5. In `routes/billing.js`, add a webhook handler for `checkout.session.completed` from the payment link: look up the invoice by `payment_link_url` and set its status to `'paid'`. Register the event in the Stripe webhook configuration.

### 3. [DONE 2026-04-23] [GROWTH] Annual Billing Plan at $99/year [M]

**App:** QuickInvoice (Node.js)
**Impact:** HIGH — annual subscribers churn at roughly half the rate of monthly; provides immediate cash
**Effort:** Low–Medium
**Prerequisites:** None (Stripe already integrated); one human action to create the Stripe price

**Sub-tasks:**
1. **[Human action]** In Stripe Dashboard, create a second price on the existing Pro product: $99/year recurring. Note the new `price_...` ID.
2. Add a Monthly / Annual toggle (Alpine.js `x-data`) to `views/pricing.ejs`; toggle swaps the displayed price and updates a hidden `billing_cycle` input.
3. Add the same toggle to `views/settings.ejs` (current plan section) so existing users can switch to annual.
4. Update `routes/billing.js` Checkout session creation: read `billing_cycle` from the request body and pass the correct `price_id` (monthly vs. annual) to Stripe.
5. Verify that existing `checkout.session.completed` and `customer.subscription.updated` webhook handlers work for annual subscription events (no format difference — spot-check the event payload).

## [HEALTH]

### 4. [DONE 2026-04-23] [HEALTH] Stripe Dunning + Smart Retries — Code Portion [S]

**App:** QuickInvoice (Node.js)
**Impact:** MEDIUM — recovers an estimated 20–30% of failed payments with zero ongoing effort
**Effort:** Very Low (code portion only)
**Prerequisites:** None for code; Stripe Dashboard configuration requires a live Stripe account

**Sub-tasks (code — implement now):**
1. In `routes/billing.js`, extend the `customer.subscription.updated` webhook handler to handle `status === 'past_due'` and `status === 'paused'`: restrict Pro features without deleting user data.
2. Add a dismissible warning banner to `views/dashboard.ejs` rendered when `user.subscription_status === 'past_due'`; include a link to the Stripe Customer Portal to update card details.

**Human action (requires live Stripe):** In the Stripe Dashboard, enable Smart Retries, dunning emails on retry attempts, and subscription pause (not immediate cancel) on payment failure.

## [GROWTH]

### 5. [DONE 2026-04-23] [GROWTH] "Created with QuickInvoice" Footer on Free Plan PDFs [S]

**App:** QuickInvoice (Node.js)
**Impact:** MEDIUM — every invoice a free user sends becomes a passive acquisition touchpoint; footer removal is a tangible Pro benefit
**Effort:** Very Low
**Prerequisites:** None

**Sub-tasks:**
1. In `views/invoice-print.ejs`, wrap a footer element in `<% if (user.plan === 'free') { %>`.
2. Render: `Invoiced with QuickInvoice · quickinvoice.io/pricing?ref=pdf-footer`
3. Style subtly (small gray text, print-safe); verify it appears in browser print preview.

---

### 6. [DONE 2026-04-23] [GROWTH] InvoiceFlow — Recurring Invoice Auto-Generation (P12) [M]

**App:** InvoiceFlow (Spring Boot)
**Impact:** MEDIUM — reduces manual work for repeat clients; increases retention
**Effort:** Medium
**Prerequisites:** None

**Sub-tasks:**
1. Flyway migration (next V number): add `recurrence_frequency VARCHAR(20)` (allowed values: `WEEKLY`, `BIWEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, `QUARTERLY`), `recurrence_next_run TIMESTAMP`, `recurrence_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT false` to the `invoices` table.
2. `InvoiceController`: add `PUT /api/invoices/{id}/recurrence` to set or clear the recurrence rule (Pro/Agency plan gate).
3. `scheduler/RecurringInvoiceJob.java`: daily `@Scheduled` job; query invoices where `recurrence_active = true AND recurrence_next_run <= NOW()`; clone the invoice (new `id`, status `DRAFT`, same line items); advance `recurrence_next_run` based on frequency.
4. Add `GET /api/invoices/recurring` to list the authenticated user's active recurring invoices.
5. Verify the existing payment reminder scheduler (`ReminderJob.java`) does not re-send reminders for DRAFT cloned invoices (check the status guard).

---

### 7. [GROWTH] Zapier Outbound Webhook on Invoice Paid (Pro Feature) [M]

**App:** QuickInvoice (Node.js)
**Impact:** MEDIUM — high switching cost once a user has integrated with Zapier or Make
**Effort:** Low
**Prerequisites:** None

**Sub-tasks:**
1. Apply migration: `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN webhook_url TEXT;`
2. Add a "Zapier / Webhook" section to `views/settings.ejs` (Pro only): text input for catch-hook URL with a Save button.
3. Add or extend a route in `routes/billing.js` or `routes/invoices.js` to accept and persist `webhook_url` for the authenticated Pro user; gate behind a Pro plan check.
4. In `routes/invoices.js`, whenever an invoice status is set to `'paid'`, check `user.webhook_url` and fire an async `https.request` POST with JSON payload `{ invoice_id, amount, client_name, paid_at }`. Do not block the response on the outbound request.

### 8. [GROWTH] SEO Niche Landing Pages for Freelancer Verticals [M]

**App:** QuickInvoice (Node.js)
**Impact:** MEDIUM–HIGH (long-term; compounds monthly with zero ad spend)
**Effort:** Medium
**Prerequisites:** Custom domain (in `TODO.md`) recommended for SEO authority; implementable without it

**Sub-tasks:**
1. Create `views/partials/lp-niche.ejs` with slot variables: `nicheTitle`, `nicheHeadline`, `nicheDescription`, `screenshotAlt`.
2. Create `routes/landing.js` with 6 GET routes mapping niche slugs to the partial; register in `server.js`:
   - `/invoice-template/freelance-designer`
   - `/invoice-template/freelance-developer`
   - `/invoice-template/freelance-writer`
   - `/invoice-template/freelance-photographer`
   - `/invoice-template/consultant`
   - `/invoice-generator`
3. Write niche-specific headline and CTA copy for each route (CTA: "Create your first invoice free" → `/register`).
4. Add `GET /sitemap.xml` route to `server.js` returning an XML sitemap listing all landing page and marketing URLs with `<lastmod>` dates.
5. **[Human action]** Submit the sitemap URL to Google Search Console after deploying.

### 9. [GROWTH] InvoiceFlow — Team Seats for Agency Plan (P11) [L]

**App:** InvoiceFlow (Spring Boot)
**Impact:** HIGH — unlocks Agency tier at $49/mo
**Effort:** Large
**Prerequisites:** Email delivery must be live (SendGrid configured per `TODO_MASTER.md` step 4) for invite emails; code skeleton is implementable now

**Sub-tasks:**
1. Flyway migration (next V number): create `team_members` table — `id BIGSERIAL PK, owner_id BIGINT FK users, member_email VARCHAR(255), invite_token VARCHAR(64), status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PENDING', created_at TIMESTAMP`.
2. `team/TeamMember.java` entity + `TeamMemberRepository.java`.
3. `team/TeamController.java`:
   - `POST /api/team/invite` — Agency-gated; validate seat count ≤ 5; insert PENDING row; send invite email with token link. **Invite email sub-task blocked until SendGrid is configured.**
   - `GET /api/team` — list owner's team members.
   - `DELETE /api/team/{id}` — remove member (Agency-gated).
4. `GET /api/team/accept?token=` — validate token; set status to ACTIVE; associate member account with owner's Agency plan.
5. Update plan enforcement to count active seats for Agency tier (max 5 active members per owner).

---

### 10. [GROWTH] "Business" Tier at $29/month / $249/year (QuickInvoice) [L]

**App:** QuickInvoice (Node.js)
**Impact:** HIGH — raises ARPU ceiling from $12 to $29/month per power user
**Effort:** Medium–Large
**Prerequisites:** Annual Billing (#3 above) should be live first; team invite emails require email delivery

**Sub-tasks:**
1. **[Human action]** In Stripe Dashboard, create $29/month and $249/year prices on a new "Business" product. Note both `price_id` values.
2. `db/schema.sql`: add `'business'` as a valid plan value; add `business_profiles` table (`id, user_id, name, address, logo_url`); add `team_members` table (`id, owner_user_id, member_email, status`).
3. `middleware/auth.js`: add `is_business` helper (`user.plan === 'business'`); apply to gated route guards.
4. Update all views branching on `user.is_pro` to also handle `user.is_business` (Business inherits all Pro features).
5. `views/pricing.ejs`: add a third pricing column (Free / Pro / Business) listing Business-only features.
6. Implement multi-profile: routes for creating, listing, and switching active business profiles; render profile selector in `views/partials/nav.ejs`.
7. `views/settings.ejs`: add Business section showing seat count, invite form, and active profiles.
8. **[BLOCKED sub-task]** Team invite flow (send invite email → accept via token → add member). Requires email delivery to be live first.

## BLOCKED — Do Not Start Until Prerequisites Are Met

### 11. [GROWTH] [BLOCKED] Churn Win-Back Email Sequence [L]

**App:** QuickInvoice (Node.js)
**BLOCKED:** Email delivery is not implemented in QuickInvoice. Complete "Add email delivery (Resend or SendGrid)" in `TODO.md` first.
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** Low–Medium (after email is live)

**Sub-tasks (ready to execute once email delivery exists):**
1. `db/schema.sql`: create `churn_sequences` table — `(id, user_id, email, step, scheduled_at, sent_at)`.
2. Set up `node-cron` daily job in `server.js` (or `jobs/churn.js`): query rows where `scheduled_at <= NOW() AND sent_at IS NULL`; send the correct email template; update `sent_at`.
3. Build 3 email templates:
   - Day 0: "Your data is safe for 30 days."
   - Day 3: "Here's what you're missing — 20% off your first month back." (generate Stripe coupon via `stripe.coupons.create`; embed link)
   - Day 14: "Last chance — invoice history will be archived soon."
4. In `routes/billing.js` `customer.subscription.deleted` handler: insert 3 rows into `churn_sequences` for days 0, 3, and 14.

### 12. [GROWTH] [BLOCKED] Monthly Revenue Summary Email to Pro Subscribers [M]

**App:** QuickInvoice (Node.js)
**BLOCKED:** Email delivery is not implemented in QuickInvoice. Complete "Add email delivery (Resend or SendGrid)" in `TODO.md` first.
**Impact:** MEDIUM — reduces passive churn by reminding users of value received each month
**Effort:** Low (after email is live)

**Sub-tasks (ready to execute once email delivery exists):**
1. Set up `node-cron` monthly job (1st of each month, 09:00 UTC) in `server.js` or `jobs/monthly-summary.js`.
2. For each Pro user, run existing `db.js` aggregation queries to retrieve: total invoiced this month vs. last, amount collected vs. outstanding, new clients invoiced.
3. Build an HTML email template with those 4 data points and a "View your dashboard →" CTA.
4. Send via the email delivery provider. Log sends in an `email_log` table to prevent duplicates on restart.
